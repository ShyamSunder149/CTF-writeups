# WWII Code? 
 Thehackerscrew are back! They have encrypted their message with a more advanced type of encryption.

We have intercepted this information in this specific order: Message: dvk{3ynxc@_1h_zd3_l@b_u0_u0} M3 UKW B VII 3 2 VII 16 3 VIII 6 3 eb ch af gd ij kp mn oz â€¦

We have also found out that they have left out 4 plugboard partners. What does this mean? Can you solve this? Flag format is RTL{flag}

Enigma machine challenge!!!!

everything is given to  the point except the last 4 plugboard configurations so I bruteforced that and got the flag

```
RTL{3nigm@_1s_th3_w@y_t0_g0}
```
