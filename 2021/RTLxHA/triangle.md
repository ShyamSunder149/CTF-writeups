# Triangle

My friend encoded the flag with XOR but forgot the key! He remembers that its a 4 byte key. Can you recover the flag? 133f29027034094a33253126395b3704

its a simple xor. First you have to xor the encrypted ciphertext with flag format to get the key and use that key to get the flag.make sure that you decode the hex before playing with xor
