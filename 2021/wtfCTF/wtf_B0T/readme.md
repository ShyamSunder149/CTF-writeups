# WTF bot
a warmup crypto challenge where you have to message the bot its name to get the ciphertext. Then I tried various ciphers and finally found that this is vignere encoded. since the flag format is 'wtfctf' I tried the known plaintext attack of vignere and got the flag with the key 'iamgroot'

flag
```
wtfCTF{D15c0rd_B0t_m4st3r}
```
