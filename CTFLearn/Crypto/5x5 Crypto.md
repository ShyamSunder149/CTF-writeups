Ever heard of the 5x5 secret message system? If not, basically it's a 5x5 grid with all letters of the alphabet in order, without k because c is represented to make the k sound only. Google it if you need to. A letter is identified by Row-Column. All values are in caps. Try: 1-3,4-4,2-1,{,4-4,2-3,4-5,3-2,1-2,4-3,_,4-5,3-5,}

## Solution
