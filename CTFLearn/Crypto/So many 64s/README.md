# So many 64s 

## Description

Help! My friend stole my flashdrive that had the flag on it. When he gave it back the flag was changed! Can you help me decrypt it? https://mega.nz/#!OHhUyIqA!H9WxSdG1O7eVcCm0dffggNB0-dBemSpBAXiZ0OXJnLk

## Solution

Just too many base 64 decodings by trial and error I found that it was 32 times encoded with base64
code in exploit.py

Flag:
```
ABCTF{pr3tty_b4s1c_r1ght?}
```
