# Symbolic Decimals

Did you know that you can hide messages with symbols? For example, !@#$%^&*( is 123456789!<br /> Now Try: ^&,*$,&),!@#,*#,!!^,(&,!!$,(%,$^,(%,*&,(&,!!$,!!%,(%,$^,(%,&),!!!,!!$,(%,$^,(%,&^,!)%,!)@,!)!,!@% However, this isn't as easy as you might think.

## Solution

this challenge is a pretty interesting one. as they gave the hint as those symbols corresponds to those numbers so I simply used my text editor to find and replace all the numbers and got an ascii code.. decoding that gave me the flag
