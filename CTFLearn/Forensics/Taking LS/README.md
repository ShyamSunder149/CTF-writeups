# Taking LS

Just take the Ls. Check out this zip file and I be the flag will remain hidden. https://mega.nz/#!mCgBjZgB!_FtmAm8s_mpsHr7KWv8GYUzhbThNn0I8cHMBi4fJQp8

## SOlution


Unzippping the zipfile in the attachment gave me 2 folders out of which I found 'MACOSX' would not be useful and I proceeded with the flag folder... then there I found the password protected flag.pdf.I thought of using john but I wanted to make sure that if there are any hidden files and luckily there was a hidden file which contained the password of the pdf and opening it gave me the flag

command for listing hidden files
```
ls -al
```

flag
```
ABCTF{T3Rm1n4l_is_C00l} 
```
