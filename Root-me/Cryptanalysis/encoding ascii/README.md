## encoding ASCII

This is a very basic beginner challenge. As when it comes to crypto we have most of the clues either in the name of
the challenge or in the given statement of the challenge. So coming to this one we have the clue in the title itself
named “encoding ASCII”.
the problem statement was simple. Just to decode the string. A link was given below which led to a webpage
containing only the ciphertext. As the title says ASCII I went trying with ASCII
decode in my very first go without any second thoughts. The ciphertext given in the webpage was:
4C6520666C6167206465206365206368616C6C656E6765206573743A20326163333736343831616535343663643638396
So I went for decoding it with python.. using the basic commands

this was the string I got when I decoded the string and since its basically a french website so the decoded
ciphertext was in french but anyhow we just need the second part of the string which is the flag and the challenge
is done!!
