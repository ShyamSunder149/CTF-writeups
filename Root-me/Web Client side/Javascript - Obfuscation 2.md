# Javascript - Obfuscation 2 

```
var pass = unescape("unescape%28%22String.fromCharCode%2528104%252C68%252C117%252C102%252C106%252C100%252C107%252C105%252C49%252C53%252C54%2529%22%29");
```
you will come to see this in the script while inspecting the source code.unescape basically gives a decoded string while passed inside.so this can be solved using a online debugger for js
