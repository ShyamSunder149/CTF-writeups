### OverlayFS-CVE-2021-3493

##About the Vuln

Recently, SSD-Disclosure released a proof of concept (and a great explanation) for an Ubuntu kernel exploit (https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-overlayfs-pe/).</br>

This vulnerability is particularly serious, as overlayfs is a kernel module that is installed by default on Ubuntu 1804 Server.</br>
If the system is vulnerable, you can very easily escalate from any user to root, as long as you can run a binary.
If there isn't a C compiler installed on the machine, you can compile the binary statically elsewhere and copy just the binary over</br>

so basically first you have to connect to vpn using THM openvpn and connect to ssh with the given credentials..</br>

the you can download the exploit program from the link given in the below:</br>
https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-overlayfs-pe/</br>

then you have to compile and execute the program and have the output as a executable binary file... you can use this command

```
gcc exploit.c -o ./exploit
chmod +x ./exploit
```

then run the exploit to get the root</br>Just go through the given directory which is /root/ and you will have the flag.txt there then use cat command to print the flag

```
THM{your-flag-here}
```

I have also exploit.c program with this repo
